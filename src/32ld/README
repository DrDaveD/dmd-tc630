PROGRAM: 32ld

DESCRIPTION: 5620 program downloader


Note: "lsys.8;7;3" in this directory is the download image for 5620 1.1
    ROMS.  The makefiles do not install it anywhere, but you can copy
    it into $DMD/lib/layersys if you want to use it to download.
    Likewise for "set_enc.j"; it is a small pre-download patch for
    5620 1.1 ROMS.  If you have a little-endian machine such as a vax
    or intel '386, you will need to convert them with 'm32conv -t vax' or
    'mc68conv -t vax'.
