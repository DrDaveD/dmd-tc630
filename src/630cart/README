copy of this manual page can be obtained using the following command:

The file SAMPLEramlist contains a sample of downloadable applications.
The file SAMPLEromlist contains a sample of rom executable application.
The file SAMPLEfontlist contains a sample font specification file.

Sample 630cart Command Line
===========================
If you had, and you probably don't, the applications and fonts specified
in SAMPLEramlist, SAMPLEromlist and SAMPLEfontlist, the command to 630cart
could have any of the following formats:

	630cart -o test -a SAMPLEramlist -r SAMPLEromlist -f SAMPLEfontlist

	630cart -o test -a SAMPLEramist -r SAMPLEromlist

	630cart -o test -a SAMPLEramlist -f SAMPLEfontlist

	630cart -o test -r SAMPLEromlist -f SAMPLEfontlist

	630cart -o test -f SAMPLEfontlist

	630cart -o test -a SAMPLEramlist

	630cart -o test -r SAMPLEromlist


The command line chosen depends on whether you have downloadable applications
and/or rom executable application and/or fonts.
Cplayer.make is a sample makefile for creating rom executable (see
SAMPLEromlist input to 630cart) application (Cplayer.c).
