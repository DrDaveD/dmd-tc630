NOTE: this has not been tested for a long time, and it looks like at
    the least the 'pfd' printer descriptor files missing and I don't feel
    like working on it because I'm not sure if anyone uses the program.
    This program has not been updated to be able to installed as both
    'xdmdps' under $TOOLS and 'dmdps' under $DMD like the other tools have.

PROGRAM: xdmdps

DESCRIPTION: bitmap capture utility

TERMINAL: 5620 DMD - requires 5620 DMD Application Development Package
	  630  MTG - requires 630 MTG Software Development Package

COMPUTER: 3B2
	  3B20
	  VAX  (requires porting the 630 MTG Software Development Package)
	  AMDAHL (requires porting the 630 MTG Software Development Package
		  and/or the 5620 DMD Application Development Package)

OPERATING SYSTEM: UNIX System V Release 2 or 3 with Windowing Utilities
		  or the 5620 DMD Core Package installed

BUILD PROCEDURE: make DMD630=<630 SDP> DMD5620=<5620 ADP> TCTERM=<terminal> \
		    TC630=<install dir> <action>

		 The <...>'s have the followings meanings:

		 <630 SDP> - full path name to the 630 MTG Software
			     Development Package. It is needed only
			     if TCTERM = 630 or all. It defaults to
			     /usr/opt/630.

		 <5620 ADP> - full path name to the 5620 DMD Application
			      Development Package. It is needed only of
			      TCTERM = 5620 or all. It defaults to /usr/dmd.

		 <terminal> - terminal for which the <action> is to take place.
			      Possibles values are: 630 - 630 MTG
						    dmd - 5620 DMD
						    all - both 630 and dmd
			      It defaults to 630.

		 <install dir> - full path name to where the product will be
				 installed. This is needed only for the install
				 action. There is no default.

		 <action> - defines the action to be done. Possible actions
			    are: build - just make the products
				 install - install the products
				 clean - remove .o's
				 clobber - remove the products under the source
					   directory
			    The default action is build.

		 requirements: the following directories must already exist
			       to do the install action:
				$TC630/bin
				$TC630/man
				$TC630/lib/630
				$TC630/lib/dmd
				$TC630/lib/dmdps/pfd
				$TC630/lib/dmdtools
				$TC630/src/dmdps/dmd630
				$TC630/src/dmdps/docs
				$TC630/src/dmdps/serial
				$TC630/src/dmdps/src

		 example: make TCTERM=all install
			  # makes and installs for the 630 and 5620 terminals

EXECUTION: To run the program, the shell environment variable TC630 must
           be set and exported to the same value as used to build xdmdps.
           The manual page describes how xdmdps works.
