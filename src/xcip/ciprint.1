.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "ciprint [-V?] [-o offset] [-t xr|i300|prt] [-f12] [printer-args] pic-files"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Ciprint
prints the pic files generated by 
.I cip
and
.IR xcip ","
one file per page, on either a Xerox 9700 (\fB-t~xr\fR),
an Imagin i300 (\fB-t~i300\fR) printer, 
or some unison (\fB-t~prt\fR) printer.
(Note: that the unison prt command will direct output to printers such 
as Xerox, Imagin or Postscript-based.)
.I Ciprint
is a shell that uses pic(1) and troff(1) 
and either dx9700(1), i300(exptools-1) or prt(1) commands.
Each picture will be centered horizontally at the top of the page.
.P
By default it uses the Xerox 9700 printer with
text point sizes of 7 and 10 only.
With the
.B "-f12"
option, sizes 9 and 12 only are supported.
Text of sizes other than these, will be resized automatically.
The Imagin and most postscript printers support most all font styles 
and point sizes available in 
.IR xcip "."
.P
The
.B "-o"
parameter allows one to specify an offset from left side of the page.
The default is "0.4".
.P
The optional 
.I printer-args
are used for example to specify the number of copies (e.g. -c3 ).
.P
The
.B "-V"
option prints out the version of 
.I ciprint
(no files are printed).

.SH WARNINGS
Xerox will simply not print pages (giving no warning) that exceed 
its internal limits.
A common example is a picture containing many vertical dotted lines.
The Imagen also has limits but they are much greater.
